This will be my personal site. I'm not sure what it will be about yet, but I love photography and my brother is a learning to be a professional photographer, so one option is for me to make a high quality photography gallery site. Another option is to make a community site for my friends who I play games with. We all live far away from eachother and communicate online for the most part.
